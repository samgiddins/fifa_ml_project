# fifa_ml_project
### In this project, I attempted to reverse engineer FIFA 19's (the video game) player rating algorithm using its public dataset. This is definitely the most length I've gone to and the most success I've had creating a machine learning algorithm in python, and I took influence from many other public Github repos. I spent some time updating the markdown so that you can see what's going on every step of the way -- I hope you enjoy!
